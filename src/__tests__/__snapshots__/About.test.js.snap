  <h4>
    Hi, my name is Michal.
  </h4>
  <p>
    I'm an aspiring Web Developer, and I'm passionate about building intuitive and beautiful UI's.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm an Ex-journalist and self taught programmer. I began my career transition a couple of years ago as part of a group called SheCodes. Since then, I've leanred HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, which lead me to a role in a startup that teaches Data Science. I helped students make a similar transition into computer science related fields, which was extremely rewarding. I fell in love with working on websites' code and discovering their structure, and my goal is to keep learning so that I could build simple yet beautiful UI's.
